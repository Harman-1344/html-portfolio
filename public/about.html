<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Harmanjit Singh, a dedicated Computer Science Engineering student at Chandigarh University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With a solid foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization, I am passionate about applying data-driven solutions to real-world challenges. My technical expertise spans Python, SQL, R, and C++, along with experience in tools like TensorFlow and Keras.


</p>

<p>I have successfully completed projects such as Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning, a Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant, and an Automatic Two-Wheeler Indicator—each highlighting my ability to combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. I am particularly skilled in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model building, and deriving actionable insights.

In addition to my technical capabilities, I bring a strong set of soft skills including leadership, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and collaborative communication. My certifications from AWS, Oracle, IBM, and Coursera further validate my commitment to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of technology.</p>

<p>I have participated in national-level competitions like the Amazon ML Challenge, where I successfully uploaded a machine learning model, and I also have experience organizing university-level events—demonstrating my initiative and teamwork.

  Beyond academics and tech, I enjoy staying active through sports and gym sessions, and I express my creative side through photography.
  
  Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully to analytics and AI-driven projects, while continuing to grow as a professional in the tech industry.
